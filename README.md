# Whatasapp Animals Prank

This is a small project I made for fun during a night using node.js and Puppeteer to prank a friend.

First I scraped the data from a website to get an array of animals names in portuguese.

Then I executed a script to enter WhatsApp Web and to sent this friend all the messages.

If you wish to do the same, you should check if the classes' names used in the code are still being used by whatsapp, as I have an impression that those change frequently. If you have any question on how to do it, you can reach me out.
